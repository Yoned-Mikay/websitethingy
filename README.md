NitroType Hack for typing. ~220 WPM and ~100% Acc. Tested only on windows but  
should work on most platforms. This was developed for educational and  
experimental reasons only, if you want to use it for more that is your own  
choice. I am not responsible for what you do with this project in any way.

## Features
- Anti-bot detection [Stealthy Bot]
  - A little while ago NitroType added selenium bot  
  detection which made this bot useless, after some  
  work I figured out some methods to make sure you  
  go completely undetected, the only issue is that  
  this may have an effect on user experience.
- NitroType auto typer
  - This will detect the letters to type and type  
  them at an accepted level, so as not to be banned.
- NitroType race grinder
  - This just goes through as many races as it can  
  automatically with zero human input, may be  
  a little buggy still but nothing you can't fix.
- Ad blocker
  - When working on the stealth features to evade  
  bot detection I realized how annoying the ads are  
  on NitroType, so I added a bit of code to remove  
  most ads from the website while your using my cheat.

## How to Use
To use you must download the main python file. After downloading the file of  
your choice you must get the latest chrome web driver, link below:

*Please Note: The hacked chromedriver file in GitHub was modified to prevent selenium bot  
detection, if you download a clean copy of the chrome driver there is a chance  
your account will be banned for using a bot.*

[Chrome WebDriver Download](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)

You must move the web driver exe file into the same folder as the python file,  
You also need to update the name of the driver inside the python file like so:
```py
webdriver_location="<exe_file_name_here>"
```

## If You Want to Copy
I'm not going to be upset if you copy my code, its open source for a reason.  
Just give credit where its desired. Don't copy if your not going to change  
anything, there isn't a point in doing that.
